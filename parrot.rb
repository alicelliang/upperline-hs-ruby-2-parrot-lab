# Now try calling your methods below with any arguments of your choice and puts them to the screen. Like this:

# call your methods here


# Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrots so that they speak backwards. How would you do that?




# The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps.
